# Deckcord
## Discord on the Deck, made easy

## Features
- Runs web discord as a separate tab in the background.
- Open/Close easily while in-game from the main menu.
- Mute/Deafen/Disconnect and check members in your channel from the QAM.
- One-button post steam screenshots to your recent channels.
- Show your current game as playing status.
- Get notifications for DMs and pings in-game.
- Push-to-talk support, with physical keybind to rear buttons. (R5 Button)
- [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) gets injected automatically before discord is loaded. It's needed to access a lot of the functionality that allows the plugin to do cool stuff, but also gives ya access to tons of other cool stuff.
- Working screenshare with audio
